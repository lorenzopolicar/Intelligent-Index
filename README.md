# 🧠 Intelligent Index System

## Overview

The **Intelligent Index System** is a modular, LLM/Agentic/RAG-driven platform designed to intelligently ingest, analyze, and manage high-volume streaming data in real time. It transforms unstructured and structured content—such as log files—into actionable insights through prompt-based extraction, contextual memory retrieval, and human-in-the-loop refinement.

The system leverages a multi-memory architecture—**Short-Term Memory (STM)**, **Episodic Memory**, and **Long-Term Memory (LTM)**—to incrementally learn and evolve based on expert feedback, enabling highly relevant and continuously improving outputs.

## 🧩 System Workflow

### 1. 📥 Data Ingestion & Buffering

Incoming data is structured as:

```json
{
  "namespace": "log_data",
  "timestamp": "2025-03-31T12:00:00Z",
  "content": "Detailed log entry or structured information..."
}
```

- Data is buffered via **Redis Streams**, organized by `namespace`.
- Buffers are flushed based on:
  - **Entry count** (e.g., every 20 records)
  - **Time intervals** (e.g., every 6 hours)

---

### 2. 🧠 Information Extraction Pipeline (via LangGraph)

Once a buffer flush is triggered, the **extraction pipeline** begins:

#### 🔍 Contextual Data Retrieval

- **Prompt Retrieval**  
  Retrieves a namespace-specific prompt via **LangMem**, continuously optimized through expert feedback.

- **Episodic Memory Retrieval**  
  Gathers relevant past expert interactions (corrections, emphasis, notes) to guide extraction accuracy and relevance.

- **Short-Term Memory Retrieval**  
  Fetches the existing STM report, which includes recent dated entries information and general knowledge.

#### 🧾 LLM Extraction Process

- Processes the buffered data using the namespace’s tailored prompt.
- Enhances extraction with episodic and short-term memory context.
- Outputs a **structured initial report** including:
  - Key events
  - General insights
  - Anomalies or trends

---

### 3. 👨‍🔬 Domain Expert Feedback Loop

- The generated report is reviewed by a **domain expert** via UI or interface.
- Experts:
  - Validate and edit extracted insights
  - Add domain-specific context
  - Flag errors or omissions
- Upon approval:
  - **Episodic memory is updated** with the interaction
  - **Prompt is refined** for improved future extractions

---

### 4. 📚 Memory Systems Update

#### 🧠 Short-Term Memory (STM)

- Updated in real time with approved insights
- Structured as:
  - **Dated Data**: Chronological events/facts
  - **Undated General Knowledge**: Persistent, timeless insights
- Stored in cloud-distributed **JSON files**
- Automatic summarization:
  - Daily → Weekly → Monthly → Quarterly → Yearly
  - Redundancy reduction, trend consolidation

**Example STM Report Format:**

```markdown
# Short-Term Memory Report

## Dated Data

### 2025-03-29
- User logins spiked between 8–10 PM
- Latency increased by 15% during peak hours

### Week of 2025-03-18
- Stable usage patterns
- Minor error spike on 2025-03-21

### February 2025
- Sustained EU engagement growth
- Three major system outages resolved

## Undated (General Knowledge)
- Peak activity between 12–2 PM local time
- Performance degrades beyond 5000 concurrent requests
- EU users maintain ~5% higher engagement than other regions
```

#### 🧠 Long-Term Memory (LTM) – *LightRAG*

Expert-refined reports are embedded into a **hybrid graph + vector store**:

- **Graph DB**: Captures relationships, causality, and metadata
- **Vector Store**: Enables semantic search and RAG-style retrieval

Provides deep contextual knowledge retrieval for agents and queries.

---

### 5. 🔎 Query-Time Retrieval

When an agent or user issues a query:

- **STM** offers immediate, high-resolution recent context
- **Episodic Memory** prioritizes insights aligned with expert interaction history
- **LTM (LightRAG)** enables:
  - Semantic search for similar entries
  - Graph-based traversal of relationships and causes

The result is **context-rich, expert-aligned, and accurate responses**.
